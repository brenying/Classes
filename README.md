# Classes Java Project

## Objective

The Classes project aimed to practice object-oriented programming concepts in Java, including class creation, inheritance, encapsulation, and working with object arrays. The focus was on simulating bank accounts, handling transactions, calculating interest, and maintaining a transaction history for multiple account types.

### Skills Learned

- Creating and using Java classes, constructors, and methods.
- Implementing inheritance and extending base classes (`Account` → `newAccount`).
- Managing arrays of objects and storing transaction data.
- Calculating and formatting interest and account balances.
- Displaying account summaries and detailed transaction history.

### Tools Used

- Java SE Development Kit (JDK) for compiling and running Java programs.
- NetBeans IDE for code editing, debugging, and project management.
- Object-oriented programming concepts for class design, encapsulation, and inheritance.
